\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

They like my ideas on versatility since the device combines weather tracking, soil health monitoring, and music playback to help plants grow. They say there can be additional features like music selection, a companion smartphone app, and an eco-friendly design that could make it even more appealing to users.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Yes, watering the plant and then getting an immediate update might be logistically difficult, depending on how the device is set up. For example, if the watering can is far away, the user may not hear the feedback right away.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

Yes, I can also allow users to select the type of music the plants will listen to since different genres may have different effects on plant growth.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.


## Part D. Wizard the device
\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
* Very creative! Love the idea of a soil condition sensor!
    * What nutrients in the soil does the sensor respond to?
    * How will the user know (for image #7, what nutrients to add? Does it differentiate / adapt the reading according the plant type where the sensor is located? Each plant grows best in soil & climate conditions unique to its species)
* Maybe the sensor can alert the user not to water the plants if it’s expected to rain today?
* Can the sensor provide immediate feedback so as to not overwater the plants?
* I really liked the diversity of information the sensor could provide (soil condition, weather, need for music).
* Can the sensor log the conditions of the plant and send notifications to your phone while you’re on vacation so that you may kindly ask your neighbor/friend to please water or attend your plants in the event of distress (as indicated by the color of the sensor)?
* For the costume, what sounds would the user hear? 
    * Do you want the sensor to be camouflaged for garden use? (Maybe a good costume would be a sensor disguised as a rock).
* For Part F: “when a person walks to bathroom during the night, the device lights up as a lamp for 1 minutes”. Is the assumption that most people take their phones with them to the bathroom when half-asleep? How accurate is this assumption? Any polls/surveys that may shine some light on how common this is?
* How is the device being charged?

# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

### Deliverables
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### storyboard
Tip: Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning.
