## Part A. General Plan 

_Setting:_ The device can be put in anywhere with plants, including home-decoration plants, lab plants, forest, jungle, etc. It reminds human of the weather and the health of soil. It can also play songs to the plants as needed, since plants will grow better when they listen to music!!!

_Players:_ Every one can involved with the device, they can know the weather and the state of plants and they can also interact with the device for commmunication and mediation.

_Activity:_ Each actor is independent. It does not matter whether who comes over, (unless with a version allows to implement detectors for botanic acadamic research purposes.)

_Goals:_ Each player can pass by the device, waive to the device, water (the plants) on the device so that the plants can grow better.


### Storyboard 1. Displaying Plant Surrounding Status 
The device indicates the conditions inclusding water, temperature, and nutrients of the soil with different colors, and reminding people to take care of the plants with sounding and vibration.
It also displays on the device shows plant-themed emojis or symbols to convey the plant's needs. A water droplet emoji could signal the need for watering, for example.

_Setting: The device is placed near a potted plant in a living room with ample natural light._
_Players: The primary player is the plant owner or caregiver. The secondary player is the device itself, designed to interact with the user._
_Activity: The device continuously monitors the conditions surrounding the plant, including soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels. It utilizes a multicolored LED display to indicate these conditions. For instance, a blue light signifies that the soil is adequately moist, a green light indicates optimal temperature, and a red light signals low nutrient levels. Additionally, the device displays plant-themed emojis or symbols on its screen to convey the plant's specific needs, such as a water droplet emoji when it's time for watering. When the plant requires attention, the device emits gentle sounds and vibrations to alert the user._
_Goals: The primary goal is to keep the plant owner informed about the plant's environment and needs, enhancing their ability to provide proper care. The device aims to simplify plant care by translating complex data into intuitive visual and auditory cues, ultimately promoting the plant's health and well-being._

### Storyboard 2. Plant Voice Assistant
The device incorporates a voice assistant feature that responds to user questions about the plant's health and care, providing tips and reminders in a conversational manner.

_Setting: The setting is a cozy home environment with indoor plants placed around the room. The device is positioned near one of the plants._
_Players: The primary player is the plant owner or caregiver, and the secondary player is the device, which functions as a voice-activated assistant._
_Activity: The device actively listens for user questions or prompts related to the plant's health and care. When the user engages with the device by asking questions like, "How's my plant doing today?" or "When should I water my plant?" the device responds in a friendly and conversational manner. It provides information about the plant's current health status, including soil moisture levels, light exposure, and any specific care recommendations. The device can also offer reminders, such as, "It's a good time to water your plant," or "Your plant is thriving, keep up the excellent care!"_
_Goals: The main goal is to enhance the user's plant care experience by providing real-time information and guidance. The device aims to make plant care more accessible and engaging by fostering a conversational interaction. It helps users understand their plant's needs, promotes proactive care, and ultimately contributes to the plant's overall well-being._

### Storyboard 3. Plant Identifier for Hiking
The device incorporates a voice assistant feature and a camera, becoming a Plant Identifier that helps users identify plants. Users can point the device at a plant, and it provides information about the plant's species and whether the fruit is edible.

_Setting: The setting is a lush hiking trail in a forest or natural wilderness with various plant species, including edible fruits and foliage._
_Players: The primary players are hikers and outdoor enthusiasts exploring the trail. The secondary player is the Plant Identifier device, functioning as a helpful tool._
_Activity: As hikers venture through the trail, they encounter unfamiliar plants. To identify edible fruits and foliage, they use the Plant Identifier device. The device incorporates a voice assistant feature and a built-in camera. Hikers point the device at the plant of interest, and the camera captures an image of the plant's leaves or fruit. The voice assistant then analyzes the image and identifies the plant species. It provides valuable information about the plant, including its common name, scientific name, edibility, potential uses, and any cautionary notes. This enables hikers to make informed decisions about foraging for food during their hike._
_Goals: The primary goal is to enhance the hiker's outdoor experience by providing a practical tool for plant identification. The Plant Identifier aims to promote safety and awareness during hikes by helping users distinguish edible plants from potentially harmful ones. It encourages sustainable foraging practices and connects users with the natural environment they explore._

### Storyboard 4. Plant Telepathy
The device incorporates with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that allow users to communicate with the plant directly through their thoughts. The device deciphers the user's intentions and conveys them to the plant in a telepathic fashion.
Based on the paper ["Psychological and Physiological Effect in Plant Growth and Health by using Positive and Negative Words"](https://www.ijirt.org/master/publishedpaper/IJIRT151445_PAPER.pdf)

_Players: The primary player is the plant enthusiast or caregiver, while the secondary player is the Plant Telepathy device, designed to facilitate a telepathic connection._
_Activity: The Plant Telepathy device utilizes advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The user wears a lightweight and comfortable EEG (electroencephalogram) headset that monitors their brain activity. As the user focuses their thoughts on a particular plant, the BCI interprets their intentions and converts them into telepathic signals._
_For example, the plant often provides subtle feedback through its physical state. It might exhibit a slight change in posture or leaf movement, signifying its acknowledgment of the user's telepathic communication. The device translates player's intent into a telepathic message to the plant, indicating nice words etc._
_Goals: The primary goal is to create a unique and immersive connection between the user and their plants. Plant Telepathy seeks to enhance the emotional bond between humans and nature by enabling users to communicate with their plants in a profound, telepathic manner. The device fosters a sense of empathy and mindfulness towards plant care while promoting a holistic and spiritually enriching experience in tending to the green companions._

### Storyboard 5. Plant Integrated Music Player
The Plant-Integrated Music Player is a device designed to enhance the plant care experience by playing soothing music or nature sounds through built-in speakers. It not only creates a tranquil atmosphere but also serves as a gentle reminder to care for the plants when needed, fostering a harmonious and nurturing environment.

_Setting: The setting is a cozy living room adorned with a variety of indoor plants, creating a harmonious green oasis within the home._
_Players: The primary player is the plant enthusiast or caregiver, and the secondary player is the Plant-Integrated Music Player device, designed to enhance the plant care experience._
_Activity: The Plant-Integrated Music Player device is equipped with built-in speakers and a carefully curated playlist of soothing and nature-inspired music._
_For instance, When the user want to study, the device responds by playing gentle, calming music or nature sounds. It creates a tranquil atmosphere in the room, enhancing the overall well-being of the plants and the user. The user can also customize the music selection based on their personal preferences and the type of plant they have. Different genres and styles of music may be associated with different plants, allowing users to fine-tune the auditory experience._
_Goals: The primary goal is to make plant care a delightful and sensory-rich experience. The Plant-Integrated Music Player aims to engage the user's auditory senses while providing subtle cues for plant care. It encourages users to maintain a harmonious environment for their plants, with music as a motivational and rewarding element in the care routine._

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

They like my ideas on versatility since the device combines weather tracking, soil health monitoring, and music playback to help plants grow. They say there can be additional features like music selection, a companion smartphone app, and an eco-friendly design that could make it even more appealing to users.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

### Deliverables
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

_Goals:_ Each player can pass by the device, waive to the device, water (the plants) on the device so that the plants can grow better.


### storyboard
Tip: Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning.

![94904e147a14df9eea6c2e82ae97774f](https://github.com/annetta-zheng/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/67286396/8c22372d-3871-417b-a107-e87c51213623)

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

They like my ideas on versatility since the device combines weather tracking, soil health monitoring, and music playback to help plants grow. They say there can be additional features like music selection, a companion smartphone app, and an eco-friendly design that could make it even more appealing to users.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Yes, watering the plant and then getting an immediate update might be logistically difficult, depending on how the device is set up. For example, if the watering can is far away, the user may not hear the feedback right away.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

Yes, I can also allow users to select the type of music the plants will listen to since different genres may have different effects on plant growth.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

It works smoothly for me :D

## Part D. Wizard the device
\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
