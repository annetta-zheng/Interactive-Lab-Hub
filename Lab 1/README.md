# Staging Interaction


In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 
- [storyboard](#storyboard)

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

_Setting:_ The device can be put in anywhere with plants, including home-decoration plants, lab plants, forest, jungle, etc. It reminds human of the weather and the health of soil. It can also play songs to the plants as needed, since plants will grow better when they listen to music!!!

_Players:_ Every can involved with the device, as long as they pass by, they can know the weather and the state of plants.

_Activity:_ Each actor is independent. It does not matter whether who comes over, (unless with a version allows to implement detectors for botanic acadamic research purposes.)

_Goals:_ Each player can pass by the device, waive to the device, water (the plants) on the device so that the plants can grow better.


### storyboard
Tip: Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

They like my ideas on versatility since the device combines weather tracking, soil health monitoring, and music playback to help plants grow. They say there can be additional features like music selection, a companion smartphone app, and an eco-friendly design that could make it even more appealing to users.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Yes, watering the plant and then getting an immediate update might be logistically difficult, depending on how the device is set up. For example, if the watering can is far away, the user may not hear the feedback right away.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

Yes, I can also allow users to select the type of music the plants will listen to since different genres may have different effects on plant growth.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

It works smoothly for me :D

## Part D. Wizard the device
\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
- Water resistance
- Eco-friendly
- Feedback Mechanism
- Ease to use


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

1. when a person walks to bathroom during the night, the device lights up as a lamp for 1 minutes

2. when the plant is in need of water, the screen is green and there will be sound reminders

https://github.com/annetta-zheng/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/67286396/49598d8d-0d55-4cd3-8b15-310fbae99f45

3. when the plant is in need of shade when the temperature is too high

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
None.


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

It will add the parts describing the current temperature/humidity/fertality level. It will also display a prediction and countdown of when will the next watering be happening or fertalizer will be added.

## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
